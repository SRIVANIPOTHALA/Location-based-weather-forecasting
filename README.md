# Location-based-weather-forecasting
Technologies : HTML, CSS, JS, Python.  Display Weather data of a particular location from selected date to one week ahead. Integrated data collection from NARL to deliver precise, localized weather predictions. This project benefits almost every sector and every individual to plan their outdoor events.
As there are many files related to weather data, I provide data to only few cities on specific dates. If you want to run this project, kindly see the date formant and city names of CSV files and use them for smooth run.
This project is a contribution to National Atmospheric Research Laboratory. As there are some specifications on this project from their side, we designed it accordingly.
